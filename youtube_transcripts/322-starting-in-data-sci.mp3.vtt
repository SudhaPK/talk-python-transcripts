00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.400
>> Sanyam, happy to have you here on the live stream and about to kick off this podcast


00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.400
recording.


00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.520
>> Michael, I'm disappointed I didn't hear the Steve Ballmer remix intro.


00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.520
>> Developers, developers, developers.


00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.520
Oh, come on.


00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.520
It's so good.


00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.520
You know it's so good.


00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.960
>> I remember that was in your first few episodes.


00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.880
I think they came out right around the time I was in university.


00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.760
But thanks for this opportunity.


00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.000
I've been a fan and listener of the show


00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.440
and really excited to be talking to you.


00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.680
- Yeah, I'm really excited to have you.


00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.920
I'm excited to hear about your journey into data science.


00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.160
It's gonna be so much fun


00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.480
because I feel like so many people out there


00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.200
looking in from the outside,


00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.320
they maybe didn't come into data science or to Python


00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.640
from a traditional computer science education.


00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.760
And they feel like, well, I didn't go through that path.


00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.000
And so I probably, this is not a good fit for me.


00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.960
And I think that's very far from the truth.


00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.080
I think there's so many opportunities


00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.600
to get into data science or to get into Python


00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.520
and programming.


00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.080
And while you do have some experience


00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.640
with computer science at the university,


00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.560
it sounds like as we'll learn through your journey


00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.440
that a lot of what is actually effective


00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.040
had very little to do with university.


00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.440
- Let me start out on a spicy note.


00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.880
I studied computer science at university.


00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.920
at one of the best universities in the country,


00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.080
it didn't make me a better programmer at all.


00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.440
Let me start with that spicy opening.


00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.760
(laughing)


00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.720
- That is spicy.


00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.040
Oh, now you've thrown it down.


00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.900
And I wanna come back to that,


00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.000
but let's just start with your story.


00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.760
What got you into programming first?


00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.920
Was this a university thing that you pursued


00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.800
or were you interested in that beforehand


00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.600
or how'd you get into programming?


00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.600
- Sure, so I was the standard nerd definition.


00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.880
I enjoyed spending time with computers.


00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.440
Whenever my parents would go to sleep,


00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.800
I'd figure out a way to sneak into the computer room,


00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.960
just play games all night.


00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.440
And along the way, I think somewhere in high school,


00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.040
I discovered programming.


00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.040
It was Java, unfortunately, but I saw the promise of it.


00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.120
I saw all of these interesting things


00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.620
that were happening around it.


00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.940
And somewhere I just made up my mind that,


00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.960
hey, I want to take up computer science


00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.100
because that's what coders do, unfortunately,


00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.500
not as I learned later.


00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.680
But that's how I got interested in it.


00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.220
And that's why I decided to take up a course in it.


00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.220
- Yeah, that's fantastic.


00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.500
I never took computer science as a major in college,


00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.540
but I studied math and I had to take a couple


00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.820
of programming courses to sort of fulfill


00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.460
my math degree requirements.


00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.760
And yeah, I found it to be a mixed bag.


00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.600
I had to learn Scheme and Lisp and I thought, well, that's not super practical, but...


00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.800
What a hoose.


00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.800
But I've got to start here. I was like, please, let's do some C++ or something.


00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.800
Like, no, no C++ for you. Darn it.


00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.080
Then I was told I had to learn Fortran because it was the most important language I would ever learn.


00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.440
Turned out to not be true, but I learned Fortran as well.


00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.680
And eventually I got into some fun languages that I got to build some things.


00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:25.520
But what I don't know how you felt, but my experience with being in a university,


00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.160
and this is speaking from doing this in the 90s, so it could have absolutely changed, right? I


00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.400
haven't gone back to a university since. But I didn't get a lot of projects that I really loved


00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.760
that I was really super excited about. It was like, well, you're going to need to learn how


00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.720
to do this algorithm by hand on paper, and you're going to need to how to implement this


00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.280
in this sort of archaic, weird language.


00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.120
You gotta do this other thing.


00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.120
- You're compiling stuff in your head through people.


00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.660
Talk about state of the art.


00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.000
- Yes, oh my gosh.


00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.340
I'm like, why?


00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.640
Why do we not get to use computers


00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.000
in our computer science course?


00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.840
This is crazy.


00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.020
I just don't get it, but here I am.


00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.160
So I didn't come away feeling like it made me


00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.480
a super good programmer.


00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.360
It gave me some exposure and some interesting experience,


00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.360
but my real exposure that got me into programming


00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.900
and told me, like revealed to me,


00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.080
like you can do this and this is for you


00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.060
was when I was doing a research project


00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.300
that had to do with math and not programming,


00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.040
but it needed a little, it needed some programming


00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.920
to do the simulations and do the work.


00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.840
And I'm like, well, now this is super fun.


00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.560
This is the kind of stuff I wanted to do.


00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.800
And I was up at 2 a.m. working on it


00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.920
in the computer labs then,


00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.840
because all of a sudden it was really cool.


00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.640
So I don't know, hopefully computer science


00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.160
is more practical these days, but yeah.


00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.040
I didn't get a big, I didn't find a huge value


00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.960
in those computer courses I took at university.


00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.480
- To be honest, like I relate to that so much.


00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.440
I could just rant about this for hours,


00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.720
but I signed up for computer science


00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.280
because there was this notion in my head


00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.080
that, hey, computer science is where you do


00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.160
programming stuff, right?


00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.480
You make computer smarter.


00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.520
And then they're teaching us all of this stuff


00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.440
that doesn't really make sense.


00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.640
Like I remember listening to talk Python those days


00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.680
and you were talking about PyPy,


00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.120
which I didn't know what it was


00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.840
because they never told us what it was.


00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.160
And I'm listening to all of this stuff


00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.840
and what they're teaching us is how to make for loops,


00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.960
print out patterns.


00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.920
Like I don't see how these things connect, right?


00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.880
You're talking about flask building apps on top Python.


00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.640
I just heard Michael talk about it,


00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.240
but now what is all this stuff?


00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.120
What is inheritance?


00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.080
does it come into the picture? And there was this huge disconnect for me. So very much


00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:49.240
echoed that experience as well, unfortunately. Yeah, that's interesting to hear you look back


00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.320
on it. One of the things that you talk about in some of your writings and some of your experience,


00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:04.920
and we'll get into it, has to do with top-down versus bottom-up learning. Before we get to that,


00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.960
I want to make sure you get to answer both opening questions.


00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.960
So what are you doing these days right now before we dive into that aspect of learning?


00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.160
- Sure. I currently work at h2o.ai, which is a company building auto email products.


00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.800
I'm sure we'll get into this later on as well.


00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.160
I work as a content creator/engineer.


00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.720
So we have a maker's gonna make culture,


00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.520
which means that I have absolute freedom to bring ideas.


00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.760
Usually people don't stop me and they encourage me,


00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.000
which also means that I can do a podcast at work. I started a podcast a while ago called


00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.160
"Chai Time Data Science" where I interview my heroes. A lot of them are Kaggle grandmasters.


00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:51.000
So we can talk about this later as well, but Kaggle has different years. Grandmaster is the


00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.160
highest one of them. S2O has, I think, more than 20 grandmasters. So at some point I said, "Hey,


00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.600
can I interview our people?" And they said, "Yes." So I have a lot of freedom over stuff I do,


00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:08.920
but it's a lot of creating content and things in those domains. So blog posts, videos, I get to do


00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:16.120
meetups as well. - That sounds like a really fun job. - It is. - This whole exploring ideas and


00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:19.400
creating content and interviewing people and just being out in the community,


00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:25.640
it's the aspect of programming that when people first hear about it, I think is extremely


00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:31.000
surprising, right? - Yes. - A lot of people think of programming, especially before they really get


00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.080
it's this solitary thing that kind of geeky,


00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.160
super smart people do mostly alone,


00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.200
mostly to avoid other contact with others, right?


00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.600
And then as you get into it, you learn like,


00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.320
actually there's a whole lot of team dynamics


00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.480
and programming.


00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.640
And then there's these roles that are like


00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.400
developer evangelists, which sounds pretty similar


00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:54.880
to what you're kind of doing, like community outreach


00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.400
on the dev side, which is very social


00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.800
and outgoing and interesting.


00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.800
And so, yeah, it's a whole spectrum.


00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.920
- It's a lot of fun for sure.


00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.080
And yeah, it would be closest to evangelism,


00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.040
but also I have a lot of freedom to do a lot of,


00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.040
honestly, anything I bring to the table,


00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.920
usually I get positive feedbacks about it.


00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.960
So I just keep doing stuff,


00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.840
even if it's interviewing people, which I.


00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.600
- Yeah, that's fantastic.


00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.400
So back to my top down, bottom up thing


00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.680
that you talk about.


00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:33.680
In a lot of academic, high school, college settings,


00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.400
the foundation is set at the beginning.


00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.000
OK, well, we're going to teach you


00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.840
how to do derivatives or differential calculus.


00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.220
So what we're going to do is we're


00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.800
going to start out real, real simple.


00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.160
We're going to talk about what does a difference look like.


00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.120
And then we're going to talk about limits.


00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.000
And then eventually, like two months later,


00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.320
you can do derivatives.


00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.800
and you can actually do calculus, right?


00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.480
But that first two months, you just have to have faith


00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.480
that I'm just gonna keep cranking on the details


00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.880
until something interesting happens.


00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.720
- But even after those two months,


00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.280
like you get to solve these problems,


00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.440
you get to, at least for me, I was able to confirm


00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.680
that, hey, the answers I'm getting


00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.840
match with those in the book.


00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.800
But what's the point of all this?


00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.520
Like, okay, I'm able to solve these problems.


00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.000
I know how to ace my tests.


00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.600
I know how to match into that.


00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.080
but where will this be used?


00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.280
I'll never find out.


00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.160
And I just didn't have the passion for it.


00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.360
My only passion was I need to get good grades


00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.680
to get into a good university.


00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.880
But apart from that, I had no--


00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.760
- I want a good job, but like, it's not the best.


00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:37.880
Yeah, yeah, I hear you.


00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.960
And I feel like so much of academics


00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.840
and many presentations and courses


00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.200
are done this way as well.


00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.880
But especially academics,


00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.100
because you have to finish it to get the grade,


00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.480
to get the degree.


00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.120
So they're like, well, it's fine if it takes three months


00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.000
before this is interesting to anyone


00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.320
because they have to stay here.


00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.360
They don't have no choice.


00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.620
Like we're gonna build up slowly bit by bit at a time


00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:03.840
for three months because guess what?


00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.600
They're all enrolled and they need this.


00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.880
This is a required course.


00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.040
And so we're gonna make sure we get every little detail


00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.820
in place along the way.


00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.120
And eventually it'll be interesting to them.


00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.280
And I just feel like that is so backwards


00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.640
from trying to capture inspiration of people, you know?


00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.520
- Somehow every single time there's always this disconnect,


00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.640
like, okay, I get it that at some point


00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.760
you have to know the concepts,


00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.880
but you never told of the bigger picture,


00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.560
which is what is a larger focus in the top-down approach.


00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.000
I never know where these individual things


00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:37.840
will really be used.


00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:41.000
It's like, before you get to drive,


00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.520
you need to know about the thermodynamics of the engine


00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.120
rather than sitting in the driver's seat.


00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.400
- Yeah, there's a beautiful Ferrari


00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.520
you wanna take out for a drive.


00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.600
And you're like, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no.


00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:53.480
"We're gonna study physics, study thermodynamics,


00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.960
"a little chemistry for the combustion."


00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.280
And then a couple of years,


00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.440
you can take that thing for a drive.


00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.280
- Exactly.


00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:00.720
- And I feel like it actually captures it pretty well.


00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.960
Contrast that with, well, let's just teach people


00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.740
the rules of taking a derivative, right?


00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.720
Derivative of X squared is two X.


00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.720
Okay, great.


00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.900
Now, let's show them how they solve cool problems.


00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.960
Like, oh, here's a ball flying through the air


00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.200
and we can figure out its velocity when it hits the ground


00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.880
based on things like the derivative


00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.040
and acceleration and so on.


00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.400
And then eventually, once you're like,


00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.040
this is really interesting,


00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.400
then you could talk about like, all right,


00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.440
now let's dig in, let's talk about like the details


00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.000
of why this math or this data science algorithm works.


00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.780
And it just, it doesn't really go that way.


00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:37.760
So I think that's definitely an interesting part


00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.320
of the journey that you had to make that switch, right?


00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:45.560
To sort of go from this like really theoretical academic


00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:50.120
- Background to, oh, I've got like a Kaggle competition


00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.120
and I've got two weeks to solve the problem.


00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.400
Like we can't be rebuilding it from the foundation.


00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.840
Let's go the other direction.


00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.720
- Yeah, and just to be clear to the audience,


00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.920
I just did a bachelor's in computer science.


00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.480
I didn't do a master's or PhD.


00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.480
I gave up on academia midway, but yeah, I go on that.


00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.480
And it's the top-down approach.


00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:19.680
was introduced to this through fast.ai, they are a big advocate of this and that's how


00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:25.800
I became a fan of this. Essentially, what they cover in their blog post is you're given


00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:31.040
the baseball bat and you get to play first rather than being taught the physics of the


00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:37.600
curveball. And I think, at least for me, in retrospect, the main challenge is throughout


00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:43.760
all of these months of learning a subject in university, you need to be able to stay motivated


00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:49.360
and remember why you've taken up a course. I took up web programming because let's say I want to


00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.800
learn how to make websites and not because I need to remember what HTML tags come in the final


00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.520
semester question every year. And somewhere in the middle you lose out on this motivation and


00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:04.160
the top-down approach essentially takes care of that. That hey, bring your project and figure


00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:10.160
out stuff along the way. And I think I mentioned in our interview, I think Talk Python courses


00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:15.120
really cover this well because you're given 10 sets of projects and you can just build them


00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:20.080
along the way. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, I mean, I really am a big fan of this because I think,


00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:25.920
and I tried to incorporate the courses that we have, because I do think you need to have these


00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.640
little wins right away. And you hear a lot of times people talk about like, well, if you're


00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.800
you're teaching kids, the kids need to have these like good experiences early.


00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.000
It's like, you know what?


00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.320
Replace kids with people like people just, they've got a lot of time and other


00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.680
options, and if you want to make them feel good and excited, like they're making


00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.720
progress, they need to make progress.


00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:51.600
Even if it's little steps at the beginning, make it feel like a legitimate


00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:55.120
progress, not just algorithms and loops and stuff like that.


00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.880
Yeah, absolutely.


00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:02.340
So you went through your computer science degree,


00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:03.800
but you didn't come out the other side


00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.560
feeling like a data scientist.


00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:10.200
And this was around the time of the MOOCs, right?


00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.120
The massive online open courses.


00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.440
Is that what MOOC stands for?


00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.280
- Yes, I think so.


00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.520
- M-O-O-S-D, I think so.


00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:17.360
Something like that.


00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.200
It might be several variations.


00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:24.560
And one of those is over at fast.ai, all right?


00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:29.560
focused on deep learning and data science type topics, right?


00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.640
- Yeah.


00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.840
So just going back to the OCDs,


00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.200
like you said, I was just really unhappy


00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.360
that, hey, there's this huge disconnect.


00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:44.360
And like any smart person in their 20s,


00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.440
I just spent a lot of evenings ranting about it.


00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.120
And at some point I decided,


00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.680
okay, this isn't gonna help me.


00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.740
And I just started signing up for every single course


00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:56.580
on the internet.


00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.940
I used to say this proudly that I've done 50 plus courses


00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.380
to my peers who would look up to me that,


00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.220
oh, this guy's--


00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:04.860
- Oh, I've only done 10.


00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.320
- Yeah. (laughs)


00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.980
But in retrospect, I was just being dumb


00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:09.420
and chasing all of these courses.


00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:13.900
Fast.ai in retrospect, and I keep saying this,


00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.460
but it's the most impactful course in my career.


00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.940
So Fast.ai is not just a course,


00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.260
it's also community and software.


00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.740
But I got introduced to top-down learning through them


00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.340
and they make you excited about this stuff.


00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:30.820
In the first lecture of the deep learning course,


00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.380
they have a bunch of courses.


00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:36.460
They teach you how to put together a few lines of code.


00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.900
Of course, you don't know what's happening behind it,


00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.740
but you build something that's state of the art


00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.500
and Jeremy Howard, the creator,


00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.780
shows you how you can get to the top of a leaderboard


00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.140
on a Kaggle competition.


00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.580
I don't know what's more exciting than that,


00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:52.740
at least to someone who was printing out star patterns


00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:53.660
in university.


00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.460
- Yeah, that's really neat.


00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:00.300
And I think the community aspect is also pretty important


00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:04.620
having that ability to sort of bond with people there.


00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:07.540
So MOOC, the M stands for massive,


00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.780
like number of massive in terms of number of people,


00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:10.960
because it's a large group,


00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.400
I haven't gone through their courses or anything.


00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:19.500
- I think at this point it's a few hundred thousand people.


00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.780
sure might be more than that. That probably counts as massive. If you


00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.980
compare it against a 30 person college course or whatever.


00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:32.140
Yeah. The biggest mind opener for me was


00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:35.660
we suck at diversity in tech. No other way of putting it.


00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:41.900
Just talking to different people on these online communities,


00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:45.420
people who don't have computer science degree or


00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.620
were coming from different walks of life, I didn't understand that, "Hey, you're


00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.940
you're supposed to have other responsibilities as well.


00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.380
You're supposed to be helping your family out.


00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:55.300
I just assume you can do this in your free time


00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.460
and that's all you do.


00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:59.340
But that was also a mind opener for me during those days.


00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:03.580
- One of the things I really value


00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:08.100
about the Python community is it's not just straight CS


00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:12.980
to sort of deep applied Python


00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.020
out of like this university chain,


00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:18.520
but rather so many people are brought in


00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.060
from different areas, right?


00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:21.480
People are interested in biology


00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.620
and they learn a little Python.


00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:25.200
People are doing astronomy and they learn a little Python.


00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.160
People are building Instagram and they're using Python.


00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.780
So there's just this diversity of viewpoints


00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.960
and specialties that comes to Python that's really unique.


00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.560
And it sounds like you kind of got that feeling as well here.


00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.360
- I was always very welcomed by,


00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.380
And the FastA community especially


00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:46.200
is very warm and welcoming.


00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.360
So at least at that time, I went to Reddit


00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.520
to ask a few questions.


00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.040
And I got a lot of harsh feedback,


00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.160
which really demotivated me.


00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.760
But FastA community was the exact opposite at that time.


00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.280
Reddit is a lot better now, and any other community


00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.400
for that matter.


00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.680
But it's a very welcoming community.


00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.220
And no one says that, hey, kid, you're


00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:10.260
not supposed to be asking these stupid questions.


00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.300
even the creator himself, Jeremy Howard,


00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.360
often hangs out in the forums, answer all of the questions.


00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.760
So it really put back the inspiration in me


00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:21.740
while I was just in this dark phase


00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.160
of nothing making sense in university.


00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.500
- Yeah, very cool.


00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:30.220
So there's a couple of things that you've done.


00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:31.180
Let's set the stage


00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.060
and then we'll dive into the details on them.


00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.300
So as you've gotten your degree,


00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:39.820
if you've gotten better in data science and deep learning,


00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:45.020
there's a handful of things you've done to sort of give back to the community and stretch yourself as well.


00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.580
One is to work on your blog and write articles.


00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:52.140
Two is to create your podcast, which I was happy to be a guest on a while ago.


00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.340
It's very nicely done.


00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.380
Thanks for saying yes.


00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:58.380
It was a very exciting moment to host you, honestly.


00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.020
Yeah, thank you.


00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:05.660
And yeah, so the podcast and then also the Kaggle competitions.


00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:10.460
So let's start with your blog posts.


00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.140
I just pick a couple out of here that are interesting.


00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.140
One of them is how not to do fast AI


00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:19.220
or any other ML MOOC course, right?


00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.060
- Yeah.


00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:24.380
- And so you go through sort of how you approached


00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.220
these courses.


00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.700
You talked about how you took 50 courses,


00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:28.140
which is on one hand,


00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.060
I think it's really awesome to get that exposure,


00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:32.060
but on the other hand,


00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:37.060
to really master programming, you need to stop


00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:45.340
and try to solve concrete problems, fail at that,


00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.740
figure out like, well, I'm trying to solve this problem.


00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.580
I can't even get a virtual environment set up


00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.220
to let me install this library.


00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.020
Like what is going, you have to hit your head against that.


00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:55.380
And it feels like you're bad.


00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.540
It's just, it's building layers of experience


00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.100
in a way that like, it's not the funnest,


00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.260
but you gotta go through those steps


00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.280
and then you sort of work your way


00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.880
into developing that experience.


00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.940
There's not a super shortcut.


00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.880
Having the courses helps give you the perspective


00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.880
and know where to focus,


00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.160
but it's still, you kind of gotta go through that path.


00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:20.040
So maybe talk us through how you approached it


00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.640
and then the advice you might have after.


00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.560
- Yeah, so, and to counter back also,


00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.520
just generally speaking,


00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:30.800
maybe I'm not the most outward looking person,


00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:35.080
But I didn't find these ideas of building any projects.


00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.320
So I couldn't think of a website that would look interesting.


00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.840
So I would just go to a course, assuming


00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.320
that I would learn all of this stuff.


00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:45.320
And a lot of these MOOCs are very nicely marketed.


00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.160
They make you feel that, OK, I'm going


00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.000
to come out learning something.


00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.740
So I just followed this trail of stuff


00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:54.580
that I would keep looking up.


00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.280
I need to know Python, so I would do a Python course.


00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:01.240
then I would take a course on different frameworks,


00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.200
keep doing that.


00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:05.740
And even at the end, I didn't accomplish much.


00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.640
Because again, there was this huge disconnect.


00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.600
Because if anyone would tell me to do anything


00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.200
that's slightly outside of the curriculum,


00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.080
I would fail at that.


00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.120
And that's just because I didn't experiment as much.


00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:23.200
And in retrospect, I should have spent at least twice


00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:28.840
as much time just trying to code even the stupidest idea


00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.280
possible instead of just watching those lectures.


00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:36.120
Because they felt in my comfort zone


00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.960
that, OK, I'm learning something.


00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.200
But I wasn't learning something at that point.


00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.600
Well, you are learning something.


00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.720
I do think that being able to watch


00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.440
the lectures of an online course and following along,


00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:51.440
like you're getting real exposure and real stuff.


00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:54.120
But you're not, even though you're feeling comfortable,


00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.800
you're not at a place where if somebody said,


00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.560
now go build something different,


00:21:58.560 --> 00:21:59.440
it's not that different,


00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.920
but it's different and do it from scratch, right?


00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.600
You're not building up that skill set


00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.560
unless you're also experimenting along the way.


00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.000
- Yes, and I'm sorry, just to clarify,


00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.400
so this wasn't for the first course,


00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.640
I had taken like at least 10 of them


00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.880
and I was watching the same stuff over and over again.


00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.840
So at that point, it was a waste of time, I think.


00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.540
- Yeah, for sure, for sure.


00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:23.360
So you said, all right, well, I'm not so sure


00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.640
that the way I was doing it was totally the right way.


00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.160
So what would you say is the right way?


00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.880
What some advice would you give there


00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.440
for being successful in these online courses?


00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.640
- Sure, I'll point out to a book by Radek Osmulski


00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.960
who I had interviewed on my podcast earlier,


00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.960
but he's put out a book that essentially talks


00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.160
about different things that you should be learning


00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.880
or how should you really approach learning.


00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:50.800
And in his book, he talks about code twice as much


00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:55.000
as reading theory, have this northern light of an idea.


00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.400
I wasn't, again--


00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:00.160
I couldn't think of anything, so I took to Kaggle competitions.


00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.840
And in my opinion, at least in my opinion,


00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.560
just do FastJ and then jump on to Kaggle.


00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:10.120
Those are the two best places to learn about data science,


00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.960
in my opinion.


00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:12.460
That's it.


00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.560
- So the Kaggle competitions are interesting.


00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:21.400
Let's maybe talk about those for a little bit.


00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.320
I haven't talked about Kaggle a lot on the show.


00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.760
I'm sure people are mostly familiar,


00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:29.080
but maybe not everyone is.


00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.120
So just tell us, what is Kaggle?


00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:36.160
- Sure, and fun fact, the CEO actually tweeted yesterday.


00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:41.160
So at this point, Kaggle is at 7 million users, I think.


00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.080
So when they say they're the home of data science,


00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:45.280
it's really the biggest community in data science.


00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.600
And why do I say community?


00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:50.240
It has competitions that are hosted on the platform.


00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.520
So different use cases for different companies


00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.400
exist as competitions.


00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.720
Now, as you can see, the first one is an example one.


00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.640
But different competitions are brought onto the platform


00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:07.720
by companies who want the community to solve a problem.


00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:11.240
In return, there are prize pools.


00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.560
But really, what people are there for


00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.600
is the knowledge sharing that happens.


00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.840
And how does that happen?


00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.720
They also have very nice discussion forums,


00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.960
as well as notebooks.


00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.580
At some point, they called it kernels,


00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:24.540
if you're not familiar.


00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.920
But essentially, you can host Jupyter Notebooks


00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.880
on the platform where people share their stuff.


00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.360
And this is the best of the best on the platform.


00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.240
So they share tips and tricks of how


00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.640
you can approach the competition.


00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:38.520
And then you start to try and compete on a leaderboard.


00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.040
And you get real-time feedback, because there are, at times,


00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.280
- Yeah, so we have a thousand people competing


00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.120
on the leaderboard,


00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.480
which may or may not be a good experience,


00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.700
speaking from my experience,


00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.100
at least for the first few competitions.


00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:51.260
But it's very exciting.


00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:54.860
- It's a little bit like a hackathon type of thing,


00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:57.120
but very focused on a data science problem,


00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.740
not on like generating an app or a website.


00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.440
Maybe that's a good elevator pitch.


00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.640
- Exactly.


00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.480
- Okay.


00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:08.800
So I'm sitting here looking at Kaggle.com/competitions.


00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.660
And yeah, I can see a bunch of interesting things.


00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.740
It doesn't explicitly say who it's sponsored by


00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:14.580
on the outside.


00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.020
Maybe if I click in, it'll say,


00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:17.820
oh yeah, this is brought to you by,


00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:22.820
or sponsored by, or put out by, so and so.


00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:28.540
But the first one is a Simphysibio RSNA COVID-19 detection,


00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:31.740
which sounds like a bunch of acronyms


00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:32.580
I don't know anything about,


00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:34.060
although I've heard of COVID.


00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:39.860
The idea is to identify and localize COVID-19 abnormalities


00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:43.140
in chest x-rays, which is interesting.


00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:46.420
And that's a genuinely useful thing


00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:48.860
that we could all benefit from, right?


00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:52.260
Having machine learning that can assist doctors


00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:53.300
and say, wait a minute, wait a minute,


00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.700
this person seems to have either had


00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.060
or currently has COVID based on this picture.


00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.120
Let's do something about that.


00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:03.900
That's genuinely helpful for society.


00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.200
- And if I can just point out,


00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.100
at least for this particular competition,


00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.460
I think it launched a few days ago.


00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.380
And just in those few days, you already have 450 people


00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:15.300
that are, I can say just hyper,


00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.180
they will be hyperactive in the discussions.


00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:20.460
And a lot of us just go there for the learning.


00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.860
I'm sure most of us just go there for the learning


00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.660
and things you get to experiment with and learn on there.


00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:31.740
- Yeah, and it says the prize for this is $100,000 US,


00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:32.900
which is pretty sweet.


00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.980
Is that split like number one gets half,


00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:38.740
number two gets a quarter and it like trails off


00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.520
Or is it all or nothing, number one or zero?


00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.400
- I think it's in the top three, sometimes in the top five.


00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.600
It varies from competition to competition.


00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:49.280
And again, it's really hard to get into the top.


00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:53.120
They have medals, they've gamified all of this stuff.


00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:56.520
And how's that helpful from an outside perspective?


00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.380
As you gain medals, you move higher up the ranks


00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:00.840
as well as tiers.


00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.240
So you start as a novice,


00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.480
then you become a quote unquote expert,


00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.120
master and then grandmaster.


00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.280
So as you earn a certain set of medals,


00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:13.580
you start on your path towards becoming a grandmaster.


00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.600
So that's more exciting than the prize pool.


00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:20.580
Again, legends or very experienced people


00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:22.240
are aiming for the prize pool.


00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.780
I don't think I've ever even dreamt of that.


00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:28.920
- Right, if it's too far out of reach,


00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.740
it's not worth trying to worry about that.


00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.320
It's more about making the progress


00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.160
and seeing yourself go up in the charts


00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.520
and gain that experience, right?


00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.080
- Yeah.


00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.400
- Yeah, so let's see some other ones


00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.660
I went and sorted by prize, the purse here.


00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.620
So Jane Street Market Prediction,


00:27:45.620 --> 00:27:49.320
test your model against future real market data.


00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.360
That's interesting, there's 4,000 teams competing for that.


00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:56.800
There's one about discover how data is used


00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.720
for the public good in the US for 90,000,


00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.880
that's pretty cool.


00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.400
Major League Baseball has one


00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:05.480
on digital engagement forecasting.


00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.100
So predicting fan engagement


00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.920
for baseball player digital content.


00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.880
- That this launch, I think less than a day ago


00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.840
and there are already 15 teams on there.


00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.080
I'm sure if you go over to this competition


00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.740
you can see some stuff in the discussion


00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.060
and kernels already.


00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:24.580
- Yeah, one that is very close to my heart


00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.520
is SETI, breakthrough listen,


00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.180
ET signal search.


00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.520
So find extraterrestrial signals


00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.960
in the data from deep space.


00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:40.960
That's pretty cool. The prize is not huge, but you know, if you were the person that discovered aliens, come on, that's a pretty good prize.


00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:54.960
And that's just zooming back to where this conversation started. Like I said, I'm not the person who could think of these ideas. And now I'm given this large number of options. Whatever is exciting to me, I can jump on that competition.


00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.000
for that competition, even if I have zero idea


00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.980
about how to approach that problem,


00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.860
there'll be plenty of stuff that's shared there


00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.180
and I can just go from there, I can just start learning,


00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:07.320
I can just try to approach this in a top-down fashion.


00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.400
- Yeah, absolutely.


00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:13.640
So another one of your blog posts that you wrote


00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.840
is your first Kaggle competition experience,


00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.320
writing basically retrospective on that.


00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:21.200
So maybe tell us what that was like.


00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.000
- Sure, so in this competition,


00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.040
And I tend to set these goals every year.


00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.920
So I just announce my goals, go big or go home, right?


00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.320
I just tweet out the craziest stuff


00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:31.440
that I couldn't imagine.


00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:33.800
Last year I wanted to lose 50 pounds,


00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:37.040
I managed to lose, I think 70 pounds.


00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.080
- Congratulations, that's massive.


00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:39.960
- Thank you.


00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.240
But yeah, I just set these goals


00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:45.640
and one of these goals was to start on competing on Kaggle.


00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:49.360
So in this competition, my first one ever,


00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.600
and all of these competitions are a similar experience.


00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.640
I just joined the quick draw rural competition


00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.140
because again, it looked exciting to me.


00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:02.160
And what I did at that time was just went to the discussion.


00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.520
I found people sharing stuff, sharing code.


00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:07.360
I just took that, tweaked a few numbers,


00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:09.840
tweaked a few parameters, didn't make much sense.


00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.960
And I started moving up the leaderboard.


00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.640
So the leaderboard is the most exciting


00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.880
and most addicting thing on Kaggle


00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.800
because you're getting this real time feedback.


00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.640
Okay, I'm doing better than these people.


00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.720
And then you go to bed, you wake up,


00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.220
someone has shared a tip or a trick


00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:29.240
somewhere in a kernel or a discussion,


00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.700
and now everyone has used that.


00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:32.600
And by the time you wake up, you're down there.


00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.440
- I see.


00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:36.440
They're like, oh, you're all just training all the data.


00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.600
What if you use like transfer learning


00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.920
on this little subset?


00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.960
This is actually totally crushing it.


00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.720
Everybody's like, we're changing what we're doing.


00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.160
And you wake up and you're falling down


00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:46.980
the leaderboard massively, huh?


00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:47.820
- Exactly.


00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:49.920
And again, now you have to get back to work.


00:30:49.920 --> 00:31:00.920
One thing you talked about in your blog post was how going through it, you got some pretty good real world experience, right?


00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:14.920
You talked about how you took all the training data, and the data is a lot for this competition.


00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:19.000
There's like a billion images described as a CSV file


00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.560
or something weird like that.


00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:24.120
And each image, and so you took all that data,


00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.240
loaded the training data, not all the data,


00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:30.240
and loaded it up and sent it over on your GPU.


00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:33.920
And it took 50 hours, like more than two days.


00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:34.760
And it cranked away.


00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:35.600
- I remember that.


00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.400
- And you expected you're gonna crush it, right?


00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.360
And it turns out that like,


00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.380
actually that made it less accurate, right?


00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.960
So you had to get more creative.


00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.800
Maybe tell us about that.


00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.280
- Yeah, and again, this was this disconnect that I found


00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.440
from these MOOCs that I was coming from


00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.600
with everything is just structured so nicely


00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.120
that it's supposed to work.


00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.240
And I just took that approach,


00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.440
okay, I'm just gonna check all of the data in a data loader,


00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.040
put it on my GPU, let it train,


00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.200
and I'll get a good accuracy there.


00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.360
It turns out not really,


00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:07.080
because it's not how this problem was structured.


00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.740
And again, I learned about all of these,


00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:11.800
I think from a practitioner's perspective,


00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.440
important things where I learned,


00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:20.000
I need to structure my project in a way because at some point I'll be on untitled 152.ipython


00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:26.080
notebook and I need to go back. I wouldn't have a track of that. I should probably do smaller


00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:30.800
experiments rather than the first one being a 50 hour long experiment. So I should try and figure


00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:36.320
out how to run it on a subset of the data. Yeah, that's a really good point because if


00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:40.720
you're waiting 50 hours per iteration that's not going to go very quickly.


00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.520
it sounds very easy and very obvious,


00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.800
but it wasn't to me at least.


00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.000
Maybe I was stupid at that point.


00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.720
- Well, I wouldn't say necessarily that.


00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.760
I mean, it probably seemed like,


00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.840
well, of course, if it's working a little bit,


00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.040
let's just give it all the data,


00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.400
then it's gonna really work, right?


00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.920
That's a pretty reasonable, naive, beginner point of view.


00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:02.640
- Yeah.


00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.240
- That that's gonna be totally fine.


00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:07.840
But then in reality, you know, reality comes along,


00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.440
you're like, well, it's more complicated.


00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:15.920
So you ended up coming with a combination of some of the larger images, some of the smaller images,


00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:18.720
and building up out of that kind of stuff, right?


00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:23.440
Yeah, so I learned that, hey, maybe I should start with 1% of the training data,


00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:30.000
put up a baseline, again, obvious stuff, and then try to work with different image sizes.


00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.640
And what I was trying to do is see if the accuracy, according to my local validation,


00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:40.160
was going up, and submitting it to the leaderboards, and just checking if it's actually


00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:45.280
working and then training bigger models through that. At that point, ResNet was, I think,


00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:50.000
state of the art. And that's what I was sticking to because I didn't have any outside


00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.920
idea about that. Other people were, of course, doing a lot of things and I was just trying to catch up.


00:33:53.920 --> 00:34:01.760
Sure. So you're a fan of Kaggle. You recommend people come along and use this for concrete ways


00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:06.000
to get started and build their knowledge beyond just theoretical stuff?


00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:12.160
100% I would just say in retrospect I would just tell myself to hey do fast


00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:16.160
a sincerely once and then just sign up for any competition and go from there.


00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:21.600
Is it better to do it with a team of people do it by yourself?


00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:28.320
I'll be honest sometimes I would not be the person working the hardest in the team so


00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:33.840
I would tell myself to at least start solo and then team up with different people. Everyone


00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:38.240
follows different approaches, but at least for me, I tend to be the lazy person. So I would


00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:42.800
make sure that I've done some homework before asking other people to join the team.


00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:50.160
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. But apart from that, when you join your team and all of my


00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:55.040
Kaggle quote-unquote successes, I would credit it to all of the teams I've been a part of.


00:34:55.040 --> 00:35:00.400
And then you get to meet all of these data scientists in a team where they're from different


00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:06.560
levels of experience and they're doing these things that I couldn't have imagined. So it's


00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:15.680
again a greater learning experience in that sense. Yeah. What's the story in terms of


00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:21.040
like people who are in the talk you talked about them being grandmasters or whatever they're


00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:25.920
called yeah there's grandmasters, masters, experts, contributors and novices in the ranking here.


00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.720
What's the job story look like, the career story?


00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:35.720
So if I'm over here and I'm one of the 1,500 masters


00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:40.780
in Kaggle, dropping that information at a job interview,


00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:43.760
is that gonna get me somewhere or not, do you think?


00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.220
- It depends on the company a lot.


00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:50.480
So we, when I say we, the company where I work,


00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.360
H2O has a lot of Kagglers.


00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.320
We have 20 grandmasters.


00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.480
I think out of the five we can see right now,


00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.320
three are a part of H2O.


00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:01.440
- Oh my gosh, yeah, that's like 10% of all of them.


00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.280
That's awesome.


00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.560
- Oh, sorry, four in the top five


00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:05.000
are a part of H2O at this point.


00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:05.840
Three of them, sorry.


00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:06.840
- Yeah, amazing.


00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.320
- So yeah, at such a place,


00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.260
they of course recognize the fact that this isn't easy.


00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:15.800
If you're a master, you're probably already in the top one,


00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:18.600
top 0.5% of the global rankings,


00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.080
and there's a lot of work behind that.


00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:23.080
So I think it does make a lot of sense.


00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:25.680
Some companies don't recognize it.


00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:29.040
maybe I've been involved to work at those companies again.


00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.760
- Yeah, that's actually an interesting point, isn't it?


00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.260
Like if the person interviewing you


00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.840
for a data science position doesn't know about Kaggle


00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:40.040
and respect like massive progress there,


00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.640
maybe you don't wanna really be on that team.


00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:46.840
Unless you're like, we're hiring you to like modernize this


00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:51.000
and set the stage and like bring like the real,


00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.040
the real stuff to us, right?


00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:54.120
But if it's like join the team,


00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.040
we'll show you how it's done.


00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:57.840
and saying, "Eh, you don't know what Kaggle is, okay."


00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:59.360
(laughs)


00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.560
- But yeah, again, it's just a portfolio of projects.


00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:03.680
You can tell everyone that,


00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.200
"Hey, I've worked on this problem


00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.920
that your company is working on."


00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.680
And against the best of the best,


00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:12.880
I ran, let's say, 10 out of 1,000.


00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.880
And that should be a huge signal to the hiring people.


00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:16.720
- I agree.


00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.520
I think, put aside the competition,


00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:22.560
put aside the, how do you rank against other people?


00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.120
If you can come over here and say,


00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.160
Oh, you see this major league baseball


00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.840
digital engagement thing?


00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.400
Yeah, I did that and it came out pretty well,


00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.880
actually solved that problem.


00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.400
And here's my GitHub repo for that


00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.480
and our conversations around it.


00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:40.560
This one about prediction of future sales also did that.


00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.640
And then this home price one,


00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.720
actually I was near the top of that.


00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:49.120
Just having that kind of portfolio to share


00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:53.960
as part of an interview is so incredibly important.


00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:59.480
So many people ask me, "Oh, I want to get a job in this thing. How do I get started? Do I need


00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:06.360
a degree X or should I go learn this technology or that technology?" All those things are


00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:13.080
interesting and valuable, but something I really like about the tech industry,


00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:16.840
but it's also challenging because that's kind of where you got to live, is


00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:22.840
it's not so much your credentials or your background that will get you the opportunities.


00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:27.080
It's I need somebody that does this. I need somebody that knows how to predict


00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:32.200
house prices. You predicted house prices. You've shown you can do it. You're hired,


00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.560
right? Like if you can show that you're doing the thing that they already need,


00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:41.000
there's not a whole large discussion going on after that, right? You're really close to


00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.480
being in the right place to do that thing. So building up this portfolio is important, I think.


00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:49.000
I managed to somewhat figure this out in my university days,


00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:56.840
out of an interest just to explore problems that I started freelancing, which was because I wasn't


00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:01.160
allowed to have a job job while being in university. And at that point, I figured out, hey,


00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:06.360
if I'm going to approach a person on, let's say, Upwork, and they want me to build something,


00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:11.960
I shouldn't be starting after we've had that conversation. If I can just look at the problem,


00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:18.280
even put together the most basic structure around it, and I can show it to them that, hey,


00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.880
I put this together in two days.


00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:22.760
If you hire me, I can build this in X amount of days.


00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:26.920
Most of the times that got me through the clients


00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:30.360
or whatever deals I've got in that world.


00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:33.720
- Yeah, and getting that first or second project


00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:35.960
under your belt, it's really important.


00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.480
I feel like Kaggle's part of that.


00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.040
Also, Upwork is interesting that you bring that up.


00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:41.880
I'm a fan of Upwork.


00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:46.120
If I was starting out and trying to get my first project,


00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:51.480
my first job and I was having a hard time in my local area finding that, I'd certainly consider


00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:55.880
looking and seeing what jobs are out there in Upwork, even if I thought they didn't pay very


00:39:55.880 --> 00:40:02.440
well or I didn't totally want them. Just having that one or two projects done and part of my


00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:10.600
resume, then you can start looking more broadly and it's just going to be such a help to have


00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:17.000
some kind of portfolio. I mean as a student the pay really didn't matter. It was a lot as a


00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.400
student but my biggest promotion in life was going from that basic food menu to looking up


00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:29.880
that menu as I started making money. That was exciting. It almost felt illegal that hey someone


00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:36.440
is paying me to write code. Yeah, yeah. I remember my first job I was so super excited it almost


00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:39.400
didn't matter what they could have paid minimum wage and I would have been thrilled about it


00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.600
because oh my gosh, someone's paying me to learn programming.


00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:43.640
And look, I have a book.


00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:46.920
I'm spending half my time just learning how to do this.


00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.840
I mean, they're basically paying me to learn this stuff.


00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:49.400
It's amazing.


00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:52.760
So yeah, I really, really had the same feeling


00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:53.800
when I was getting started.


00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.560
Fantastic.


00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:56.920
All right.


00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:00.600
So another interesting area around what you're doing


00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.040
has to do with your podcast.


00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:07.880
So maybe we could talk about a couple of your interviews


00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:09.240
that you've done that you really liked.


00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.120
that you found interesting.


00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:18.600
So yeah, you want to tell us about a couple of them?


00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.600
- Sure, so at some point, how this started


00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.280
was I was doing all of these.


00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.020
I was trying to essentially explore


00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.800
different areas of content creation.


00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.400
I started with blogging.


00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:32.000
Fast AI gurus, Jeremy Howard, told us to write blog posts.


00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.920
So I started doing that.


00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:37.360
And at some point, I found this disconnect of advices.


00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.360
So I reached out to a friend that, hey, would you--


00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:41.740
you've been helping me a lot.


00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:44.580
Is it OK if I put this together in a blog post


00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:46.580
and put it out in the world?


00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:47.940
And that went on for a while.


00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:50.180
I started this as a blog series.


00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:53.320
And later, after I graduated, I thought, OK,


00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:56.100
maybe if I do this as a podcast-- and I'm sure you would agree.


00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:59.660
I could explore all of these great people's mind


00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:00.900
in a bigger depth.


00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:04.540
So that's how the podcast started for me.


00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:05.040
Yeah.


00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.880
- Well, I think one of the big secrets


00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:14.460
about having a podcast is I get to be the first listener,


00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:16.140
basically, to all these interviews, right?


00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:17.420
I mean, I guess now that we're live streaming,


00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:20.140
it would have like 50 first listeners or something,


00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:21.180
whatever it turns out to be.


00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:25.420
But it's really amazing, the opportunity


00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:29.480
to just meet these people that you're really interested in,


00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.540
especially with conferences being gone and stuff now,


00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.460
that's really hard to find time to like meet up


00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:35.020
and just talk about them.


00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:37.660
But hey, you can have them as a guest on your show.


00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:38.860
It's really nice.


00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:39.700
- Exactly.


00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:41.580
So coming back to my favorite interviews,


00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:44.060
I try to interview people about their journey.


00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:47.260
Someone, as someone who's trying to understand


00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:50.460
how did this great person, Radek Osmulski,


00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.340
we have Radek Osmulski's interview on top.


00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:55.020
He's one of my heroes from Fast.ai.


00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:58.780
But how did someone like him learn programming?


00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.380
How did they learn how to Kaggle?


00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:03.020
How did they break into the field?


00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:05.740
and we, at least in the interviews, I try to ask them,


00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:07.000
did you face this problem?


00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.300
How did you overcome it?


00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:13.060
My three favorite interviews would be Radek's,


00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:14.980
Dima Damin's and Radha's.


00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:18.300
So I try to interview people who are Kagglers,


00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:19.620
practitioners and researchers,


00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:21.220
essentially anyone I can find


00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:22.980
who would like to share their journey.


00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:26.140
And these are from all three aspects, essentially.


00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:26.960
- That's cool.


00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:31.960
Dima, Damon, she did video recognition and computer vision.


00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:34.540
- That sounds super interesting.


00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:36.900
- And I remember in her interview,


00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:37.940
I started by asking her,


00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.440
"Hey, when you were doing your research,


00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.620
"you were just using OpenCV.


00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.340
"What do you think about it nowadays?"


00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:46.160
Apart from that,


00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.660
it's also a lot about her research perspective.


00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:51.460
So Dima is very much experienced


00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:52.980
and is a great orator as well.


00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:54.860
So she was talking about


00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:58.500
how to approach your first research project


00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:00.260
or how to just go about research.


00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:01.180
What is even research?


00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:05.180
someone who doesn't understand what that word means and that's what I try to explore in all of


00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:11.820
these interviews. Yeah, so let's go back to Kaggle for just a minute because something you touched on


00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:19.340
is really interesting. I know there are a lot of research teams and groups at universities


00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:26.300
who are trying to build models, they're trying to build mathematical algorithms, they're trying to


00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:30.780
to do research, I feel like maybe some of these Kaggle competitions would be really,


00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:36.240
really good to say, as part of our research project, let's take what we're trying to develop


00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:41.600
here and try to actually apply it to one of these competitions and see where it stands.


00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:46.940
For sure. And it's highly encouraged, at least in the community, some organizers, so the


00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:54.240
sponsors of the competition invite you to present your solution even in research conferences.


00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:58.920
And apart from that, even if you end up creating a blog post or a research paper outside of


00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:02.900
it, the community is very close and they recognize it instantly.


00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:08.600
And they know that, I mean, nothing against research, but at least this particular solution


00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:12.200
has been tried and tested against this leaderboard and it works really well.


00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:15.720
It is quite cutting edge because it's been tested against all of these people.


00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:16.720
Yeah.


00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:17.720
Yeah.


00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:18.720
Very neat.


00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:19.720
All right.


00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:24.400
queued up for us is Andrada Altianu.


00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.140
Yeah, Altianu, yeah.


00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:29.120
- The best part about these interviews


00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:31.160
is I just get to meet all of these people


00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:33.460
with such amazing energy and such openness


00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:34.320
about their journey.


00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:37.160
This was again, such a fun interview


00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.360
because Andrada was so open about her journey.


00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.080
I was, at that point, I was just starting


00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:43.640
my journey in data visualization


00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.120
and I asked her, "Hey, Andrada, did you feel the same


00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:49.560
"that you couldn't plot things against X and Y axis


00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.720
and then you would have a hard time figuring out where they are ending up,


00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:55.880
because at least for me, I couldn't understand what's going on.


00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:59.760
And yeah, that's that's what we discussed about.


00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.880
And she was essentially talking about how she started her journey


00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.920
as someone who's fairly new to coding.


00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:10.560
And at this point, she's become a Kaggle Grandmaster in kernels.


00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:13.680
And she's been writing all of these amazing notebooks.


00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:16.480
And in this interview, we just learned about how she went about that


00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:19.480
as someone who just started out and then learned all about this


00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.080
as they went about it.


00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:23.160
>>Yeah, that looks like a really interesting interview,


00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:25.880
and somewhat similar to the conversation we're having here,


00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.080
right?


00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:28.680
>>I think so, yes.


00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:30.800
>>Yeah, yeah.


00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:34.240
All right, one final area that I want


00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.440
to make sure we get to spend some time on is,


00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:39.880
you work at h2o.ai, and have had a lot of experience


00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:41.220
with these different frameworks.


00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:46.360
Maybe we could do a survey of the various deep learning ML


00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:50.680
libraries and you could sort of tell me how they compare and your thoughts on the various ones.


00:46:50.680 --> 00:47:00.600
Sure, so the vision set forth by our founder, co-founder and CEO is Makers Gonna Make and what


00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:05.880
we're trying to do on a philosophical level is just create products that allow people to build


00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:11.640
stuff. So with that vision and this is just my take on it not from a company's perspective,


00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:15.320
they've built together all of these auto ML products.


00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:19.320
So, Wave being the latest one, I'm sure we'll talk about this, but apart from that


00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:23.000
they started out with the open source H2O3,


00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.400
which was an auto ML framework. It's still one of the most widely used ones,


00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:32.280
followed by Driverless AI, which is an end-to-end


00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:36.440
auto ML product, where essentially you just upload your data,


00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:39.640
and what I like to call the Ironman mode,


00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:43.240
where you just click a button, it figures out what models need to be trained,


00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:46.440
does all the feature engineering, and puts out a nice model for you.


00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:53.800
So we have this arsenal of Ultramel products at this point, open source and both enterprise facing


00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:56.360
aimed at different problems, Wave being the latest one of them.


00:47:56.360 --> 00:48:03.480
Yeah, yeah, Wave, H2O Wave is pretty interesting. I guess it's at wave.h2o.ai,


00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:08.500
And it's a real-time web app dashboard


00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:11.060
for Python and data science.


00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:14.080
And a lot of the data science things I see


00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.700
are about making static graphs,


00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:18.760
or maybe graphs that you can go and explore.


00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:20.560
Like I could move my mouse over


00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:23.100
and it'll highlight information about different parts,


00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.420
and I could zoom into it and whatnot.


00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:28.620
But this is like a real-time changing dashboard,


00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:32.100
like a stock market, or like a factory,


00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:32.920
or something like that.


00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:37.000
what's happening as time passes. I wish you said crypto market.


00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:47.640
Yes, exactly. So the reason I spoke about the philosophy is because I think this is the next


00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:52.920
bigger goal for the company. What we're trying to create is, and I'm not sure if this is out yet or


00:48:52.920 --> 00:49:00.280
not, we're trying to build a public app store of AI apps. So Wave is an open source framework


00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:05.800
that takes care of a lot of the things that as a data scientist, at least I wouldn't want


00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:12.120
to worry about. I don't want to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript. So it's just a framework that takes


00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:18.760
care of all of the UI, UX stuff, does it very nicely. I don't have to worry about messing up


00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:23.960
because it's taken care of. And then I can build different AI apps. As a company, what we're trying


00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:29.640
to do is we're also putting out an app store where you can already use the open source apps if you


00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:34.040
want. And you can also contribute your own apps if you want.


00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:42.280
Yeah, very cool. So, there's a bunch of cool examples. There's a whole gallery full of


00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:47.640
many, many different things that you can go and write. Basically, Wave is an open source


00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:55.640
dashboard for Python developers that don't have to do web stuff, but they can share it as the web,


00:49:55.640 --> 00:50:00.760
right as a website. Exactly. And just to be clear for the audience, when I say we,


00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:05.960
my biggest contribution would probably be this interview. But again, it's this amazing team of


00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:13.160
engineers who have been building these products at H2O that they know how to scale them and how to


00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:18.200
properly engineer them through all of this experience. It's really a data science focused,


00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:23.960
data scientist focused product. Yeah, you know, excuse me, every now and then there's like a


00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:27.640
project, I'm like, or something out there, like, I really wish I had a reason to use


00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:32.120
this. This looks like really fun to play with. I just have no use for it personally.


00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:38.600
This is one of those things, right? I would love to have an excuse to use something like this and


00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:44.760
make it go, but I just don't have that much data that changes that much in my world.


00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:52.040
Maybe you could put together a web page of Talk Python where different episodes structure


00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:56.100
and the listeners can see a dashboard in real time.


00:50:56.100 --> 00:50:56.940
- That'd be cool.


00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:58.420
Like maybe downloads in real time


00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:00.620
and interaction in real time, comments.


00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:01.500
Yeah, for sure.


00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:02.660
Something like that.


00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:03.500
- Yeah.


00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:05.140
- Yeah, I mean, I could definitely like put


00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:06.020
a little bit of something,


00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:08.340
but if you worked at a place that like


00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:10.640
had a lot of stuff going on,


00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:14.260
like a factory or like a big e-commerce site or something,


00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:18.580
you could make a really cool live app out of this stuff.


00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:20.140
I feel like.


00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:20.980
- For sure.


00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:22.980
It's still under development.


00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:26.900
And all of our grandmasters who have this rich experience


00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:28.420
are also contributing to it.


00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:30.660
So I'm sure by the time this interview goes out,


00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:32.580
we would have added a lot to it.


00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:33.940
- Yeah, that's cool.


00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:36.500
It's already got 2.6 thousand GitHub stars.


00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:37.140
That's pretty cool.


00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:39.060
So really, really nice.


00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:42.740
Maybe let's talk about some of the other mainstream ones as well,


00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:46.020
like Keras, TensorFlow, Fast.ai.


00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:48.740
Give us your thoughts on these different frameworks.


00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:50.740
obviously it's your opinion, not like a


00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:52.740
an endorsement or a deep dive or whatever,


00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:54.740
but just what do you think about these


00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:56.740
people or do you have experience with all


00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:57.700
of them?


00:51:57.700 --> 00:51:59.700
Yeah, just to be clear, I strongly endorse


00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.700
Fast.ai, I've been a fan of that, that I'll


00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:03.700
agree on, but from that I


00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:05.460
started my journey with


00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:08.340
TensorFlow and at least in that day,


00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:10.260
of course, TensorFlow has come along with


00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:12.740
the Keras API has been merged, but I was


00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:14.580
really struggling with it because it had


00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:15.620
this static


00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:17.620
graph structure and it didn't feel


00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:24.340
Pythonic. Not that I was a good Python programmer, I'm still not. So that's why I took to Fast.ai.


00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:31.540
And what cares is to TensorFlow, Fast.ai is somewhat to PyTorch. PyTorch follows this


00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:36.900
more Pythonic approach and Fast.ai is a wrapper but more on top of PyTorch.


00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:43.780
Okay, interesting. Yeah, so Fast.ai is maybe a little easier to get started with, you think?


00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:53.940
Yeah, sure. So the nice thing about FastAI is it is a very heavily opinionated library. So there


00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:58.500
are a lot of things that have been baked into it. And for some reason, whenever I just switch to


00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:02.260
PyTorch, I'm not able to replicate similar accuracies. That's what I mean, because


00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:09.300
somewhere the defaults are so good that it always gets better results. But essentially, it's this


00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:15.620
layered API and from an end user perspective I could just use the high level API where they have


00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:20.900
on the left you can if you click on applications you can see the different applications that they


00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:27.060
support or if I want to work on something that's cutting edge I can also use the training loop


00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:34.180
which is really nice and just bring in a pytorch model and connect that. Yeah okay yeah that looks


00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:36.580
It's really cool.


00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:37.540
Again, computer vision.


00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:40.460
I want to build a game that play-- a computer game,


00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:43.820
computer game AI that plays me in real life.


00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:47.020
Like put a camera over, say, a chessboard,


00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:50.100
and it'll play me, but not just on the screen,


00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:53.140
but as I actually move the things, it'll see.


00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:54.860
That'd be fun.


00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:56.420
Maybe I can try that out here.


00:53:56.420 --> 00:53:57.260
Sounds really cool.


00:53:57.260 --> 00:53:58.500
Yeah.


00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:00.180
Yeah, just a little bit of interaction


00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:02.780
with some real something or other there.


00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:03.980
That sounds cool.


00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:06.180
but a lot of options these days, right?


00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:09.080
And we've got all these different deep learning libraries


00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:14.080
and yeah, many, many things to choose from, right?


00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:16.300
- Again, one of the things that I've learned


00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:17.420
at least from the podcast


00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:19.060
and this is the collective opinion


00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:20.620
of everyone I've interviewed.


00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:22.580
Again, you don't need to worry about the framework


00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:25.620
as much as you really understand the concepts.


00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:27.020
So that's why I encourage fast here


00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:29.400
because it's also a course around the framework.


00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:31.860
So you once, at least from my perspective,


00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:34.640
when I've gotten around to learning all of these things,


00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:37.940
it shouldn't be that hard to switch to another framework,


00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:40.840
depending on whatever your job requires you to do


00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:44.000
or whatever your project needs you to use.


00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:44.840
- Yeah.


00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:47.460
Cool, yeah, learn the foundation,


00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:50.380
solve the problem one way, and then you can solve it


00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:53.560
with some other library more easily again and again.


00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:56.060
- It's really hard for me to remind myself that,


00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:58.620
hey, the problem is what I'm trying to solve


00:54:58.620 --> 00:54:59.980
and not create more problems.


00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:02.600
I don't want to learn more of different things,


00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:05.020
but I need to figure out how to minimize my time


00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:07.960
in a way that I actually solve the problem.


00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:10.900
- Yeah, I think one interesting thing


00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:13.700
that people learn as they get more experience


00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:17.820
is even if the technology is super different, right?


00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:19.680
If I learned how to build something interesting


00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:22.720
in JavaScript, I think maybe I know nothing about Python,


00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:23.760
so how am I gonna do that?


00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:25.640
But actually what you've learned over in one place


00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:29.580
is really way more transferable and reusable.


00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:31.920
like the way of just thinking about solving problems,


00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.140
the way of thinking about,


00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:35.280
okay, I gotta pay attention to this and not that.


00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:37.340
So what's important in this library,


00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:40.400
picking the right library, are these things and so on.


00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:43.820
- And of course, you should keep switching


00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:45.020
between frameworks as well.


00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:46.780
The thing for me was I was switching


00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:48.420
as a very early stage developer,


00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:49.860
I'm still a very early stage,


00:55:49.860 --> 00:55:52.780
if I can even call myself a developer.


00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:56.060
And I was switching between frameworks every 15 days


00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:57.540
just because they looked exciting.


00:55:57.540 --> 00:56:00.240
that's not the right thing I would tell myself to do.


00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:01.420
(laughing)


00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:02.540
- Yeah, this is true.


00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:03.380
This is true.


00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:05.880
Get comfortable in one and then you can move around.


00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:08.380
But yeah, don't just chase the shiny thing


00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:09.780
all over the place for sure.


00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:12.300
Although in the data science world,


00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:14.140
there's so many shiny new things


00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:15.420
that there are to pay attention to,


00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:17.020
and visualizations and libraries


00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:19.060
and charting and graphing and whatnot.


00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:21.540
It's easy to get distracted, I think.


00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:23.340
- For sure, and that's why I mentioned


00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:24.940
I need to remember what I'm working on.


00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:26.140
So I need to make the graph


00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:28.000
and not figure out how to make it prettier


00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.780
as long as it does what it's supposed to do.


00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:31.620
- Yeah, exactly.


00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:32.980
- That framework looks exciting.


00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:34.660
Maybe I should try that over the weekend


00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:35.700
and now I'm spending.


00:56:35.700 --> 00:56:38.180
- More like here's an excuse to try that framework.


00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:39.780
This is my chance to try it.


00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:41.060
So I'm gonna go do it.


00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:42.220
- Exactly.


00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:43.320
- Exactly.


00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:44.160
Cool, all right.


00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:46.060
Comment on the live stream.


00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:49.500
Davidas says, "Hey, some advice on getting started


00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:54.380
"on web development or data science, Python."


00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:57.740
I'll throw out a little bit, then you can add your thoughts.


00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:03.180
I would say you need to have some foundation in just Python basics.


00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:07.580
You need to know variables, loops, functions, that kind of stuff.


00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:11.020
But don't, kind of like the beginning conversation we had,


00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:16.540
don't go so deep and say, "Well, I've got to completely understand everything about this language


00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:19.380
before I take the step to my first web app,


00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:23.420
or before I take the step to firing up Jupyter and doing my first analysis."


00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:26.160
Like, don't do that.


00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:28.360
Just get comfortable with the basics.


00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:31.480
Start building, and as you go into more advanced areas,


00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:33.400
then you're like, okay, well now I kinda need to learn


00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:35.120
about what is a list comprehension.


00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.440
But I didn't need it before,


00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:38.580
but now I'm gonna like just add it on as you need it.


00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:41.360
Don't try to exhaustively learn Python.


00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:45.200
And then, Sanyam, what would you say like after that?


00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:48.080
- Michael, but first question for you,


00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:49.440
what are the basics really?


00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:51.120
That's one thing I really struggle with.


00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:54.520
I still struggle with because I look around on Twitter,


00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:57.160
everyone smarter than me is talking about this stuff.


00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:58.680
And they say, it's pretty basic.


00:57:58.680 --> 00:57:59.500
Is it?


00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:02.800
Am I the stupid person who needs to know all of this?


00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:05.320
- Well, here is the interesting thing.


00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:08.960
Like there's the people who are blogging,


00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:11.200
the people who are recording YouTube videos


00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:13.560
or people who are tweeting about things,


00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:16.960
they're already at like some certain level.


00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:20.720
And then they're super psyched about something advanced


00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:22.020
that they've just learned,


00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:25.160
or some really cool scalability thing that they've learned.


00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:27.220
And there's a really good article says,


00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:28.060
titled something like,


00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:30.140
you're not Instagram, you're not Google,


00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:32.180
you're not LinkedIn or so.


00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:34.300
So you don't need all these crazy design patterns


00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:37.460
and this like crazy cloud architecture


00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:38.920
that companies like that have,


00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:41.020
because you're a two person startup


00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:42.380
that doesn't even yet have a business.


00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:45.420
Build something simple, worry about,


00:58:45.420 --> 00:58:49.440
zero downtime chaos monkeys later.


00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:50.580
Focus on the simple, right?


00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:56.260
And I think there's a lot of people that are fascinated by either looking up, like, look


00:58:56.260 --> 00:59:00.340
where we could go and look at what Instagram is doing, look at what Google is doing.


00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:05.360
And they are amazing and interesting what those companies and teams are doing, but they


00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:07.580
don't apply to you now.


00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:13.980
So I think there's just a lot of really interesting conversations about stuff that's interesting,


00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:17.260
but not applicable to people who are beginners at all.


00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:20.860
right? So I need to master Dockers and Kubernetes? Probably


00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:24.060
not. Can you run it on your computer? Yes. Okay, then start


00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:26.740
there. We'll worry about Docker. Like once you get something


00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:30.220
working, maybe we'll put it in a container, but not now. Don't


00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:31.620
worry about that now get started.


00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:36.100
Exactly. And just just build. So to the person asking this


00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:40.540
question, focus on getting the website up and give yourself a


00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:42.820
deadline. That's that's why I love setting rules publicly give


00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:49.300
yourself 10-20 days to figure out the Python basics and put together first website. You


00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:54.180
won't like it in retrospect, you might hide it from a GitHub. I do that a lot. And over


00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:58.980
time you'll polish it. It doesn't have to look like, like you said, Facebook or Instagram


00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:02.660
when it comes out. It just needs to function somewhat when and sometimes you'll click a


01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:08.060
button something will fail. But then you figure out that, okay, I need to fix this now. And


01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:11.820
now you have stuff to do. And then you can think of other things. Okay, maybe I should


01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:12.900
Maybe I should add this.


01:00:12.900 --> 01:00:14.940
Maybe I should add a button.


01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:16.300
You're making progress already.


01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:17.980
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.


01:00:17.980 --> 01:00:19.300
And the other thing to keep in mind


01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:20.820
is that software is plastic.


01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:21.860
It's malleable.


01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:23.340
It can be changed.


01:00:23.340 --> 01:00:25.660
You don't have to get it right the first time.


01:00:25.660 --> 01:00:28.200
You have to just make progress.


01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.980
Then you've learned more than you change it


01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:31.380
and you make more progress.


01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:33.680
And so many people can get hung up,


01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:34.860
like not even getting started.


01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:36.580
'Cause like, oh, I'm not really sure how to get started.


01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:38.340
Like, just take a step.


01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:39.740
If it's wrong, you take a step


01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:40.860
at a slightly different direction


01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:42.020
you get in the right place.


01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:44.820
That's how you do it without getting hung up,


01:00:44.820 --> 01:00:48.940
without trying to boil the ocean by learning everything.


01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:49.780
- Exactly.


01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:53.660
- All right, maybe that's a good place to leave it there


01:00:53.660 --> 01:00:54.860
for that conversation.


01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:57.260
But yeah, it's super interesting to hear your story


01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.140
and congratulations on the success


01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:02.820
coming from getting started with small projects in college


01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:06.420
to working for H2O AI.


01:01:06.420 --> 01:01:07.620
- I'm still learning a lot,


01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:09.980
but again, thanks so much for this opportunity.


01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:14.780
like I said, I think there are two types of teachers. First, that they introduce you to


01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:18.700
something and the second that make you really interested in it. You were the second one to me


01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:23.100
because I just got so excited about all of these things through your podcast and of course there


01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:27.660
were others as well but you were a major part of it and yeah thanks for this opportunity.


01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:31.260
Oh yeah, thanks so much. Now you're not out of here yet though, you got to answer the


01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:35.660
the two final questions. If you're going to write some Python code, what editor do you use?


01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:42.540
Jupyter notebook. Okay, yeah, right on. And then is there some library or something on PyPI you've


01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:47.180
come across where you're like, "Oh, this is super cool. Gotta tell people about this."


01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:50.620
I keep running into all of them every second day.


01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:57.180
But I would say just discovering Fast.ai was the biggest wow moments for me.


01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:00.140
Yeah. All right. So Fast.ai. Perfect. That's a good one.


01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:06.380
All right. Final call to action. People are interested. They're maybe also listening,


01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:10.700
get into programming, get into data science, and what advice do you have for them?


01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:18.940
Just build something or just go to Kaggle if you can't figure out what project to work on.


01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:23.740
I still struggle with that inspiration a lot, so I would just tell myself to go to Kaggle and sign


01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:29.980
up for any competition that I like the most and go from there. Probably take fast.ai along the way


01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:36.220
and you're all set. All right, fantastic. Well, thanks so much for being here and catch you later.


01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:40.540
Thanks so much. Yeah, bye.
